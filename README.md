Simple Rss Notifier

This simple script is used to download a copy of a RSS feed, check if the item entries are already in the database, and if not it will notfy you.

Simply edit the config.php file, and run the cron.php file whenever you find necessary (each minute?)
There are plenty of cronjob-services out there you can use for free.

This is also my first time using PDO - so bear with me. If you have any suggestions please let me know: twitter @welrachid

Enjoy
